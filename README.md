## Project Description:
    Future of energy is constantly changing, with interest in renewable energy option increasing and potential decrease of interest in non-renewable options. Our group project will focus on the realistic projection of renewable energy takeover from non-renewable by analyzing energy demands and production, political regulation with the end goal of identifying stock options that will be profitable in each sector as well as when one of the sector (renewable vs non renewable) will take over.


## Research Questions:
    1.) Future stock performance comparison across renewable and non-renewable energy sector
    2.) Is it actually feasible to use mostly renewable energy?
    3.) Political and regulation impact on these stock performance

## Dataset Sources:
    - EIA.gov (energy data)
    - API.org (Oil and Gas data)
    - Data.gov (potentially for political and regulatory data)
## Task Breakdown :
    - Proposal approval
    - Dataset collection/API
    - Dataset clean-up and documentation
    - New Python library (geopandas, pyfolio)
    - Visualization
    - Final analysis
    - README.md containing the project introduction, visualization and summary/finding
