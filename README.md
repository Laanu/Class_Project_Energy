    Future of Energy
## Members:
    - Laanu Adeyeye

    - Daniel Stroe

## Project Description:
    - Future of energy is constantly changing, with interest in renewable energy option increasing and potential decrease of interest in non-renewable options.  
    - Our group project will focus on the realistic projection of renewable energy takeover from non-renewable by analyzing energy demands, 
    - production and political regulation with the end goal of identifying stock options that will be \ profitable in each sector.  
    - As well as when one of the sector (renewable vs non renewable) will take over.


## Research Questions:
    1.) Future stock performance comparison across renewable and non-renewable energy sector
    2.) Is it actually feasible to use mostly renewable energy?
    3.) Political and regulation impact on these stock performance

## Dataset Sources:
    - EIA.gov (energy data)
    - API.org (Oil and Gas data)
    - Data.gov (potentially for political and regulatory data)
    - Kaggle.com (Renewable energy)
